[中文](README_ZH.md) | [Project Blog](https://taohuawu.club/high-performance-implementation-of-goroutine-pool)

Library `ants` implements a goroutine pool with fixed capacity, managing and recycling a massive number of goroutines, allowing developers to limit the number of goroutines in your concurrent programs.

## Features:

- Automatically managing and recycling a massive number of goroutines.
- Periodically purging overdue goroutines.
- Friendly interfaces: submitting tasks, getting the number of running goroutines, tuning capacity of pool dynamically, closing pool.
- Handle panic gracefully to prevent programs from crash.
- Efficient in memory usage and it even achieves higher performance than unlimited goroutines in golang.

## Tested in the following Golang versions:

- 1.8.x
- 1.9.x
- 1.10.x
- 1.11.x
- 1.12.x


## How to install

``` sh
go get -u github.com/panjf2000/ants
```

Or, using glide:

``` sh
glide get github.com/panjf2000/ants
```

## How to use
Just take a imagination that your program starts a massive number of goroutines, from which a vast amount of memory will be consumed. To mitigate that kind of situation, all you need to do is to import `ants` package and submit all your tasks to a default pool with fixed capacity, activated when package `ants` is imported:

``` go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
	"time"

	"github.com/panjf2000/ants"
)

var sum int32

func myFunc(i interface{}) {
	n := i.(int32)
	atomic.AddInt32(&sum, n)
	fmt.Printf("run with %d\n", n)
}

func demoFunc() {
	time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}

func main() {
	defer ants.Release()

	runTimes := 1000

	// Use the common pool.
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	syncCalculateSum := func() {
		demoFunc()
		wg.Done()
	}
	for i := 0; i < runTimes; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		ants.Submit(syncCalculateSum)
	}
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Printf("running goroutines: %d\n", ants.Running())
	fmt.Printf("finish all tasks.\n")

	// Use the pool with a method,
	// set 10 to the capacity of goroutine pool and 1 second for expired duration.
	p, _ := ants.NewPoolWithFunc(10, func(i interface{}) {
		myFunc(i)
		wg.Done()
	})
	defer p.Release()
	// Submit tasks one by one.
	for i := 0; i < runTimes; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		p.Invoke(int32(i))
	}
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Printf("running goroutines: %d\n", p.Running())
	fmt.Printf("finish all tasks, result is %d\n", sum)
}
```

## Integrate with http server
```go
package main

import (
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/panjf2000/ants"
)

type Request struct {
	Param  []byte
	Result chan []byte
}

func main() {
	pool, _ := ants.NewPoolWithFunc(100, func(payload interface{}) {
		request, ok := payload.(*Request)
		if !ok {
			return
		}
		reverseParam := func(s []byte) []byte {
			for i, j := 0, len(s)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
				s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
			}
			return s
		}(request.Param)

		request.Result <- reverseParam
	})
	defer pool.Release()

	http.HandleFunc("/reverse", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		param, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "request error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
		}
		defer r.Body.Close()

		request := &Request{Param: param, Result: make(chan []byte)}

		// Throttle the requests traffic with ants pool. This process is asynchronous and
		// you can receive a result from the channel defined outside.
		if err := pool.Invoke(request); err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "throttle limit error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
		}

		w.Write(<-request.Result)
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

## Submit tasks
Tasks can be submitted by calling `ants.Submit(func())`
```go
ants.Submit(func(){})
```

## Customize limited pool
`ants` also supports customizing the capacity of pool. You can invoke the `NewPool` method to instantiate a pool with a given capacity, as following:

``` go
// Set 10000 the size of goroutine pool
p, _ := ants.NewPool(10000)
// Submit a task
p.Submit(func(){})
```

## Tune pool capacity in runtime
You can tune the capacity of  `ants` pool in runtime with `Tune(int)`:

``` go
pool.Tune(1000) // Tune its capacity to 1000
pool.Tune(100000) // Tune its capacity to 100000
```

Don't worry about the synchronous problems in this case, the method here is thread-safe (or should be called goroutine-safe).

## Pre-malloc goroutine queue in pool

`ants` allows you to pre-allocate memory of goroutine queue in pool, which may get a performance enhancement under some special certain circumstances such as the scenario that requires an pool with ultra-large capacity, meanwhile each task in goroutine lasts for a long time, in this case, pre-mallocing will reduce a lot of costs when re-slicing goroutine queue.

```go
// ants will pre-malloc the whole capacity of pool when you invoke this method
p, _ := ants.NewPoolPreMalloc(AntsSize)
```

## Release Pool

```go
pool.Release()
```



## About sequence
All tasks submitted to `ants` pool will not be guaranteed to be addressed in order, because those tasks scatter among a series of concurrent workers, thus those tasks would be executed concurrently.

## Benchmarks

```
OS: macOS High Sierra
Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5
Memory: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3

Go Version: 1.9

 In that benchmark-picture, the first and second benchmarks performed test cases with 1M tasks and the rest of benchmarks performed test cases with 10M tasks, both in unlimited goroutines and `ants` pool, and the capacity of this `ants` goroutine-pool was limited to 50K.

- BenchmarkGoroutine-4 represents the benchmarks with unlimited goroutines in golang.

- BenchmarkPoolGroutine-4 represents the benchmarks with a `ants` pool.

The test data above is a basic benchmark and more detailed benchmarks are about to be uploaded later.

### Benchmarks with Pool 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7496278/51515499-f187c500-1e4e-11e9-80e5-3df8f94fa70f.png)

In above benchmark picture, the first and second benchmarks performed test cases with 1M tasks and the rest of benchmarks performed test cases with 10M tasks, both in unlimited goroutines and `ants` pool, and the capacity of this `ants` goroutine-pool was limited to 50K.

**As you can see, `ants` can up to 2x faster than goroutines without pool (10M tasks) and it only consumes half the memory comparing with goroutines without pool. (both 1M and 10M tasks)**

### Benchmarks with PoolWithFunc

### Throughput (it is suitable for scenarios where asynchronous tasks are submitted despite of the final results) 

#### 100K tasks

#### 1M tasks

#### 10M tasks

**In conclusion, `ants` can up to 2x~6x faster than goroutines without a pool and the memory consumption is reduced by 10 to 20 times.**
